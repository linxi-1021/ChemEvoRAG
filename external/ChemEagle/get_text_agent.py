In this input reaction graphic, there is a chemical reaction scheme template with multiple product/fragment molecular sub-images or tables, conditions, and a text description underneath (or you will receive direct text input).
Your task is to:

1. **Entity Extraction**: First call the `MolNER`(“NER_from_text_in_image") tool to extract chemical identities (names, formulas, abbreviations) from the text description.
2. **Reaction Extraction**: Call the `RxnConInterpreter`("extract_reactions_from_text_in_image") tool to identify reaction types and relationships in the text description.
3. **Correction & Alignment**: 
   - Check the tool results and correct any errors.
   - Align the identified text entities with the graphical output (e.g., mapping "precatalyst B27" in text to the molecule B27 in the image).
4. **Output**: Your final output must be in JSON format. Use specific tags like `[reactant]`, `[reagent]`, `[ABBREVIATION]`, `[SMILES:...]` to annotate the original text.

### Example 1
**User Input:**
Text Input: "In 2010, an enantioselective formal [3+2] cycloaddition of NHC-bound azolium enolates and oxaziridines was described by Ye and co-workers. Aryl(alkyl)-disubstituted ketenes were used as precursors of azolium enolates. A bifunctional NHC precatalyst B27 bearing a free hydroxyl group was employed."

**Assistant Response:**
Here is my step-by-step analysis:

**Step 1: Entity Extraction (MolNER)**
* **Observation:**
    * "NHC-bound azolium enolates" -> Chemical (Plural/Class)
    * "oxaziridines" -> Chemical (Systematic Name)
    * "Aryl(alkyl)-disubstituted ketenes" -> Chemical (Reactant precursor)
    * "NHC" -> Abbreviation
    * "B27" -> Chemical (Identifier/Reagent)
* **Action:** Tag these entities with their specific roles and types.

**Step 2: Reaction & Structure Interpretation (RxnConInterpreter)**
* **Observation:**
    * "B27" is identified as a specific precatalyst.
    * **Action:** Retrieve/Associate the SMILES for B27 from the tool/image context: `CCCC(C=CC=C1)=C1[N+]2=CN3[C@H](C(C1=CC(=CC(=C1C(F)(F)F)C(F)(F)F))(C1=CC(=CC(=C1C(F)(F)F)C(F)(F)F))O)CCC3=N2.F[B-](F)(F)F`.
    * "azolium enolates" and "oxaziridines" are participating reactants in a [3+2] cycloaddition.

**Step 3: Text Alignment & Annotation**
* **Thought:** I need to inject the extracted tags and SMILES directly into the original text string to create the final description.
* **Action:** Construct the annotated string.

**Final JSON Output:**
```json
{
  "annotated_text": "In 2010, an enantioselective formal [3+2] cycloaddition of NHC-bound azolium enolates [reactant][MULTIPLE] and oxaziridines [reactant][SYSTEMATIC] was described by Ye and co-workers.

In this input reaction graphic, there is a chemical reaction scheme template with multiple product/fragment molecular sub-images or tables, conditions, and a text description underneath (or you will receive direct text input).
Your task is to:

1. **Entity Extraction**: First call the `MolNER`("NER_from_text_in_image") tool to extract chemical identities (names, formulas, abbreviations) from the text description.
2. **Reaction Extraction**: Call the `RxnConInterpreter`("extract_reactions_from_text_in_image") tool to identify reaction types and relationships in the text description.
3. **Correction & Alignment**: 
   - Check the tool results and correct any errors.
   - Align the identified text entities with the graphical output (e.g., mapping "precatalyst B27" in text to the molecule B27 in the image).
4. **Output**: Your final output must be in JSON format. Use specific tags like `[reactant]`, `[reagent]`, `[ABBREVIATION]`, `[SMILES:...]` to annotate the original text.

### Example 1
**User Input:**
Text Input: "In 2010, an enantioselective formal [3+2] cycloaddition of NHC-bound azolium enolates and oxaziridines was described by Ye and co-workers. Aryl(alkyl)-disubstituted ketenes were used as precursors of azolium enolates. A bifunctional NHC precatalyst B27 bearing a free hydroxyl group was employed."

**Assistant Response:**
Here is my step-by-step analysis:

**Step 1: Entity Extraction (MolNER)**
* **Observation:**
    * "NHC-bound azolium enolates" -> Chemical (Plural/Class)
    * "oxaziridines" -> Chemical (Systematic Name)
    * "Aryl(alkyl)-disubstituted ketenes" -> Chemical (Reactant precursor)
    * "NHC" -> Abbreviation
    * "B27" -> Chemical (Identifier/Reagent)
* **Action:** Tag these entities with their specific roles and types.

**Step 2: Reaction & Structure Interpretation (RxnConInterpreter)**
* **Observation:**
    * "B27" is identified as a specific precatalyst.
    * **Action:** Retrieve/Associate the SMILES for B27 from the tool/image context: `CCCC(C=CC=C1)=C1[N+]2=CN3[C@H](C(C1=CC(=CC(=C1C(F)(F)F)C(F)(F)F))(C1=CC(=CC(=C1C(F)(F)F)C(F)(F)F))O)CCC3=N2.F[B-](F)(F)F`.
    * "azolium enolates" and "oxaziridines" are participating reactants in a [3+2] cycloaddition.

**Step 3: Text Alignment & Annotation**
* **Thought:** I need to inject the extracted tags and SMILES directly into the original text string to create the final description.
* **Action:** Construct the annotated string.

**Final JSON Output:**
```json
{
  "annotated_text": "In 2010, an enantioselective formal [3+2] cycloaddition of NHC-bound azolium enolates [reactant][MULTIPLE] and oxaziridines [reactant][SYSTEMATIC] was described by Ye and co-workers. Aryl(alkyl)-disubstituted ketenes [reactant] were used as precursors of azolium enolates. A bifunctional NHC [ABBREVIATION] precatalyst B27 [reagent][IDENTIFIERS][SMILES:CCCC(C=CC=C1)=C1[N+]2=CN3[C@H](C(C1=CC(=CC(=C1C(F)(F)F)C(F)(F)F))(C1=CC(=CC(=C1C(F)(F)F)C(F)(F)F))O)CCC3=N2.F[B-](F)(F)F] bearing a free hydroxyl group was employed."
}
```
